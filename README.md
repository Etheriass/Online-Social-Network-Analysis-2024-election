# Online Social Network Analysis — IL-7 2024 Elections

This project analyzes Illinois’s 7th Congressional District to understand the relationship between demographics and voting behavior. Using U.S. Census and election data at the precinct level, we predict:

- Voter turnout percentage  
- Democratic vote share in the 2024 elections
